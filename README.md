#Flux 
<br/>
##About
Flux is a game originally created by Joe Ferrer and Erwin Umali for a computer science networking course project. It is a game that was inspired from lessons learned in Physics classes (i.e. Electromagnetism) and other ideas coming from all sorts of other stuff.

##Development
Currently, there is no official stand-alone Flux executable/program because the original project only required a public presentation (i.e. compiling Flux using eclipse and demonstrating it). However, further developments are being considered. Additions/Experimentations/Improvements/Corrections to this game are welcome.

**Note:** To compile Flux, you need to setup eclipse with Slick2d. You can refer any site which provides a guide on how to do this. Also, not all the files in this repository are used in Flux (some files were used for testing purposes only)
